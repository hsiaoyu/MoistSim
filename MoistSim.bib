abstract="We present a novel unified framework for simulating burning phenomena of thin-shell objects such as paper, cloth, etc. A gradient-based spreading model is proposed to simulate the movement of fire on thin-shell objects. To simulate the crumpling and deformation of thin-shell objects when burning, we present an FFD-based deformation model which takes the physical theory of burning phenomena into account. The fire is rendered by the method of particle systems. By inputting different parameters and initial conditions, our framework can simulate various burning phenomena of different thin-shell objects. Experiments validate that it is efficient and easy to implement.",

abstract  ="Non-Euclidean plates are plates ({"}stacks{"} of identical surfaces) whose two-dimensional intrinsic geometry is not Euclidean{,} i.e. cannot be realized in a flat configuration. They can be generated via different mechanisms{,} such as plastic deformation{,} natural growth or differential swelling. In recent years there has been a concurrent theoretical and experimental progress in describing and fabricating non-Euclidean plates (NEP). In particular{,} an effective plate theory was derived and experimental methods for a controlled fabrication of responsive NEP were developed. In this paper we review theoretical and experimental works that focus on shape selection in NEP and provide an overview of this new field. We made an effort to focus on the governing principles{,} rather than on details and to relate the main observations to known mechanical behavior of ordinary plates. We also point out to open questions in the field and to its applicative potential."}

We constructed thin gel sheets that undergo laterally nonuniform shrinkage. This differential shrinkage prescribes non-Euclidean metrics on the sheets. To minimize their elastic energy, the free sheets form three-dimensional structures that follow the imposed metric. We show how both large-scale buckling and multiscale wrinkling structures appeared, depending on the nature of possible embeddings of the prescribed metrics. We further suggest guidelines for how to generate each type of feature.},
